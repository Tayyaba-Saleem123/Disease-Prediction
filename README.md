<h1 style="color:#1F4E79;">Disease Prediction Using Random Forest Classifier</h1>

This repository contains a Python script that trains a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict disease outcomes based on patient symptoms and demographic information. The **dataset** includes attributes such as symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, fatigue), patient profiles (e.g., age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels), and the outcome variable.

<h2 style="color:#1F4E79;">Key features of this project:</h2>

- **Data Preprocessing**: Categorical variables are encoded using `LabelEncoder` to prepare the data for machine learning.
- **Model Training**: The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the dataset, and the data is split into training and testing sets for performance evaluation.
- **Performance Metrics**: The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Prediction Functionality**: A dedicated function allows users to input new patient data and receive predictions on disease outcomes.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare, focusing on accurate and efficient disease prediction.
